# PyCrossSection
A modular code for channel cross-section evolution in both free-surface and conduit-full (i.e. water filled caves) conditions.

This code provides a CrossSection class holding the geometry of the channel as a series of x, y points, with methods for calculation of area, wetted perimeter, position finding along the geometry, and evolution of the geometry. It also provides a method for finding a stage height given geometry and a discharge. A flow class is provided to calculate boundary shear stress along the cross-section based on the Wobus, Tucker, and Anderson (WTA) method from Wobus et al. [2006, 2008].
